( each command is repeated for mother and father VCF file as well)

# remove polyploidy from each raw VCF file 

$  bcftools +fixploidy child.vcf> child_fixed.vcf  

# zip the VCF file

$  bgzip -c child_fixed.vcf > child_fixed.vcf.gz


# index VCF file 

$ bcftools index child_fixed.vcf.gz

# merge all the VCF files of the family

$ bcftools merge *.vcf.gz -Oz -o merged.vcf.gz

# identifying the relatedness between the members of the family based on KING method 

$  vcftools --gzvcf merged.vcf.gz --relatedness2 --out ajk

#### ROH analysis by using PLINK 

# converting raw VCF file for PLINK-suitable input

$  vcftools --vcf child_fixed.vcf --plink --out myplink

# apply PLINK

$ plink --bfile UPD-Child --homozyg --allow-extra-chr --double-id --homozyg-window-snp 2 --homozyg-snp 2 --homozyg-kb 2000 --homozyg-density 100 --homozyg-window-het 2
